# Running the *playlist_reccomendations.py script* #
* The script has been modified for the electron app however, the orignal CLI has been kept so that it can be used as a standalone module.
* Remember to add your spotify client credientials to the constants at the top of the script from https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/
## Once changed to its standalone module ##
* Navigate to the directory of the downloaded repo and run command ```python .\playlist_recommendations.py -h``` to see the CLI.
* Run the module using ```python .\playlist_recommendations.py -a "artist name" -t "track name"```
